* Need to add a couple of things to the platform:
	* 1st: ability to add snippets to be rated and the ability to rate current snippets
	* 2nd: suggestion black box 
		- Need to do:
			-> look at the correlaiton of readability ratign and feature
				+ these are the features that correlate strongly with code readability:
					o avg_line_len
					o avg_periods
					o avg_parentheses
					o avg_assignments
		
			-> determine what is strong enough to be considered good for your study
			-> fit linear regression models on the single features 
			-> make prediction of user ratings based on that 
			-> suggest improvement if rating is below a threshold
