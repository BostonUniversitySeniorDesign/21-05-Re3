- For this one, since we are now using vars, we have not yet generated the updated data. Could you send an updated csv with the vars? The last 5 vars columns do have data but that was before it was updated so we just ignored it before.

## Questions

- What are the sizes of the figures supposed to be?
  We found the sample one you provided on Friday to be too small so we scaled some of the graphs that were hard to read, is that ok? The sample had figsize=(3.48,2.3).
- For the font scale is there also a standard?
