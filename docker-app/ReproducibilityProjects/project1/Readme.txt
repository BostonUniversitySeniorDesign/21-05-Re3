The files contained in this folder are used to produce the results of the analysis in Cottrell's "Using computer simulations to measure the effect of gerrymandering on electoral competition in the U.S. Congress." There are three other files in this folder. "CottrelLSQreplication.R" is an R script containing the source code for the results, "CottrelLSQreplication.Rdata" is a data file containing 2 data sets that source code is dependent on, and "datadictionary.docx" describes the variables in each of the data sets. To replicate the results, simply run "CottrelLSQreplication.R" from source.
