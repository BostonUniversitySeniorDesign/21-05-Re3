# RE3

In the research community, there is a lack of awareness surrounding the readability of code and the reproducibility of results in studies involving software. Many researchers do not come from a computer science or engineering background, which can lead to code that is often difficult to read or reproduce. Therefore, our project proposes to provide an open-source platform that allows users to evaluate the reproducibility and readability of research code. Specifically we will design a dashboard that hosts research projects for the general public to evaluate, an automatic containerization service of research projects and a code readability service. Ideally by doing this, researchers will be incentivized to review the reproducibility and readability of their projects and therefore fast track the process of leveraging research results.
